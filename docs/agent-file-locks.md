# Agent File Locks

This file tracks active file ownership for multi-agent work.

Agents must reserve files here before editing.

## Rules

- If a path is locked by another active agent, do not edit it.
- If a task needs a locked path, stop and ask for arbitration.
- Release or move the lock to `RELEASED LOCKS` after merge.
- Do not remove another agent’s lock without explicit user approval.
- Sensitive files require explicit ownership.
